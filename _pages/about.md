About me🧑‍🚀
======
Hi there! 👋 I'm Shengbang Liu, an undergraduate student in the School of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am a research intern at [Human Machine Intelligence Lab (HMI)](https://pku-hmi-lab.github.io/HMI-Web/research.html) and Simple Robots, supervised by Prof. [Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/). I am also privileged to be mentored by Prof. [Weishi Zheng](https://isee-ai.cn/~zhwshi/) in the [Intelligence Science and System Lab (iSEE)](https://isee-ai.cn/#/home) during my undergraduate studies.

My research interests primarily focus on **Robotic Manipulation** 🤖, with the goal of developing generalizable, versatile, and robust robot agents. I am also exploring **Reinforcement Learning** 🍭 and **Multimodal Large Models** 🧠.

I am driven by a passion for exploration, the joy of creation, and the excitement of what comes next! 🤩
