About me
======
Hi there! 👋 I'm Shengbang Liu 🧑‍🚀, an undergraduate student in the School of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/)🎓. Currently, I am a research intern at [HMI Lab](https://pku-hmi-lab.github.io/HMI-Web/research.html) and Simple Robots, supervised by Prof. [Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/). I am also privileged to be mentored by Prof. [Weishi Zheng](https://isee-ai.cn/~zhwshi/) in the [Intelligence Science and System Lab (iSEE)](https://isee-ai.cn/#/home)🌟 during my undergraduate studies.

My research interests primarily focus on Robotic Manipulation 🤖, with the goal of developing generalizable, versatile, and robust robot agents. I am also exploring Reinforcement Learning 🍭 and Multimodal Large Models 🧠.

I am driven by a passion for exploration 🤩, the joy of creation 💡, and the excitement of what comes next! 🚀
